  <h1>To Gillian</h1>

  <p>I remember a girl from school — a legal secretary, I think. Gillian was cool, genuinely cool. Big heart. Kind. A good student. The kind of person I wish I'd had the courage to know. But I didn't. That was on me. Not the school, not her — me.</p>

  <p>I was reserved. Too much had happened. I mistook cruelty for friendship more than once. There were guys who smiled at me one day and threw rocks the next. I learned to stay small, to disappear. And in doing that, I missed out. Not on everything — but on enough.</p>

  <p>I carried pain like a badge. Being molested. Betrayed. Overlooked. I let those shadows take up all the space. But the truth is, there were good people too. I just didn't know how to see them.</p>

  <p><strong>Gillian</strong> was one of them.</p>

  <p>Years later, I saw her name. I reached out. She responded — kindly. And I messed it up. Made a fool of myself. But before I did, she gave me something rare: a moment. Recognition. Proof that I wasn’t invisible. That maybe I never had been. And that stayed with me.</p>

  <p>If Gillian ever reads this — I want her to see it first. Right here. Not buried on some page you’d never click to. Because she deserves to know: she mattered. She made a difference. She gave me a chance. And she gave me something else too — a future.</p>

  <p>Because if not for Gillian, I never would’ve met Dawn. Never would’ve lived the life I have. I would’ve ended things. Quietly. Long ago. Gillian saved my life — just by being who she was.</p>

  <h2>And Then Came the Silence</h2>

  <p>There was no silence. My mind told me I was better off dead. Unworthy. Useless. A waste of space.</p>

  <p>I felt death would be such a release from myself.</p>

  <p>I didn’t think about Gillian, or anything. My mind just kept tormenting me. The pills weren’t thought out — I just wanted out. But as they slowed my thoughts, something shifted. I realized what I had done. I called 111. They told me to wake my dad. I did — but not happily.</p>

  <p>I could have died. It’s a thin line between life and death. And sometimes a kind word is enough to stay on the living side.</p>

  <p>For me, Gillian’s warmth — years ago — kept me on the right side of that line.</p>

  <p>If you can relate to this, let me tell you: you are not alone. I care, and so do many others. While there is life, there is hope. But not if you die.</p>

  <p><strong>Please</strong>, talk to someone. Reach out. Don’t worry about the right words — just say what’s in your heart. Say: I can’t cope. I don’t know what to say. I think I want to die. Please help.</p>

  <p>You're not invisible. You're not beyond saving. You're still here — and that matters.</p>
