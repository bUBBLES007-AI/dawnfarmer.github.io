    <h1>To Gillian</h1>

    <p>I remember a girl from school — a legal secretary, I think. Gillian was cool, genuinely cool. Big heart. Kind. A good student. The kind of person I wish I’d had the courage to know. But I didn’t. That was on me, not the school, not her … me.</p>
    
    <p>I was reserved. Too much had happened. I missed opportunity for friendship more than once. There were guys who smiled at me one day and threw rocks the next. I learned to stay small, to disappear. And in doing that, I missed out. Not on everything … but on enough.</p>

    <p>I carried pain like a badge. Being moody. Betrayed. Overlooked. That those shadows take up all the space. But the truth is, there were good people too. I just didn’t know how to see them.</p>

    <p>Gillian was one of them.</p>

    <p>Years later, I saw her name. I reached out. She responded — kindly. And I messed it up. Made a fool of myself. But before I did, she gave me something rare … a moment. Recognition. Proof that I wasn’t invisible. That maybe I never had been. And that stayed with me.</p>

    <p>If Gillian ever reads this … I want her to see it. Right here. Not buried on some page you’ll never click to. Because she deserves to know she mattered. She made a difference. She gave me a chance. And she gave me something else too — a future.</p>

    <h2>And Then Came the Silence</h2>

    <p>I didn’t want to die. I just couldn’t see another way. I cared. I cared too much. My mind wouldn’t stop — telling me I was worthless, that I’d ruined everything, that everyone would be better off without me. I believed it. The sleeping pills weren’t some grand gesture. They were me trying to make it all stop. Not because I didn’t care — but because I did. Because it hurt too much to keep going. And I didn’t know how to say that.</p>

    <p>But as the pills started to slow my mind, I saw it. What I’d done. What I almost lost. That was the moment something shifted. Not healed. Not fixed. Just... shifted. And I came back.</p>

    <p>That was how it was for me. I could have died. But I didn’t. And if you’re feeling anything like that — I pray you’ll talk to someone. Anyone. Because you matter. Your life matters. And no matter how bad it feels… death is not the answer.</p>
